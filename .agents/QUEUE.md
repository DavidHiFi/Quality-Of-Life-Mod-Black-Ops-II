# QUEUE.md — one change at a time

**Rule (user, 2026-08-06):** nothing new starts until the item in flight is **confirmed working
in-game by the user**, with no bugs and no compromises. New requests get appended here and
acknowledged, not begun.

**"Deployed" is not "done".** Only a boot moves an item out of §1.

---

## 1. IN FLIGHT — deployed, AWAITING THE USER'S VERIFICATION

### Fog pushed back instead of removed — **v1.57.0**
Reads each map's own fog (`g_fogStartDistReadOnly` / `HalfDist` / `Color`) and re-applies it with
the distances scaled out, so the fog still looks like that map's fog but starts further away and
hides the world edge.

**Tune it live, no rebuild:**
| command | effect |
|---|---|
| `.fog` | show the current setting |
| `.fog <number>` | multiple of the map's own fog distance — **default 6**, higher sees further |
| `.fog off` | no fog at all (the mod's previous behaviour) |
| `.fog stock` | the map's own fog, untouched |

**Tell me the number that looks right and it becomes the default.** Check on Diner/TranZit where
the world edge was visible.

Verified offline: parses, deployed `mod.iwd` carries `zmqol_fog_think` and the `.fog` command, and
the old forced `r_fog 0` is gone.

## 2. QUEUED — in order, not started

1. **Pause-menu UI** — port the Strat Tester options menu (`H:\Claude\Strat-Tester-BO2`), header
   renamed **"Quality Of Life"**, exposing every existing chat command **plus** ones missing from
   the menu (infinite sprint, etc). Chat commands stay. Scoped already: `optionsstrattester.lua`
   881 lines, `options.lua` 560, `menu.gsc` 73; no LUI conflict with this mod's `ui_mp\`.
   🛑 A bad LUI file hard-crashes the game — this one ships alone.
2. **`night_mode 1` is broken** — the screen goes fully black (screenshot 2026-08-06). Came in from
   another script. Either fix it properly or remove it.
3. **`character` command does nothing** — no visible effect at all.
4. **Origins Wunderfizz replacement** — replace Origins' native machines with the mod's, keeping
   generator-power gating, relocation, ball behaviour and per-machine ball visibility.
   Blocker on record: Origins' `scriptmover` clientfield set is **32/32 full**.
5. **Galvaknuckles wallbuy on Bus Depot** — in the Tombstone room. Town, Farm and Diner already
   have one; Bus Depot does not. 🛑 Survival **only** — must NOT appear on TranZit proper, where
   the Diner wallbuy already covers it. Same `!is_classic()` gating as the other survival edits.
6. **Vulture Aid icon on the Wunderfizz** — the machine's perk icon set is missing Vulture.
7. **No prone points at Mob's Electric Cherry machine** — the +100 prone bonus does not fire there.
   Every other machine works, so this is likely a missing `vending_` tag for that machine.
8. **Solo must not behave like a custom game** — two parts:
   - a. Origins first-generator reward chest still gives Zombie Blood instead of double points, on
     the classic maps. NOTE: `qol_check_solo_status` shipped in v1.55.0 and the probe printed
     `expected=1 is_forever_solo_game=1`, so **re-verify before changing anything** — the flag is
     set, so if the chest is still wrong the cause is downstream of it.
   - b. The solo **intro cutscene** does not play — you get the custom-games loading screen instead.
9. **Death Machine pickup voice line** — the BO1 "Death Machine" announcer callout on pickup.
10. **Nuketown perk-machine placement** — Deadshot's icon lands at an angle, Speed Cola drops half
    into the ground in the back yard. Not diagnosed yet.
11. **Diner teddy bears** — the 3-bear secret-song easter egg on Diner survival (garage, diner,
    Juggernog room). **Blocked:** needs three `.where` readings from the user; coordinates will not
    be guessed.
12. **zm_refreshed weapon ports** — MP7 + Vector to all maps, Dragunov + Spas-12 to Nuketown and
    Mob, MGL to Mob, Remington transferable via fridge, B4KED's fixed Jetgun, **Quick Revive on
    Mob** (confirmed absent; `specialty_quickrevive_zombies` is in no zombies fastfile, so it needs
    shipping). ~400 assets into `mod.ff` — do these **one weapon at a time** with an ownership
    audit after each.

---

## 3. PARKED — known-open, not currently requested

- **T5 wonder weapons** (Thundergun / Wunderwaffe / Winter's Howl). Reverted at v1.56.x after three
  byte-identical crashes: `0x80000003` at `0x129F75DB`, an engine assert with no script or asset
  error. Every asset class was checked and resolved. Leading unproven theory: a hard engine ceiling
  — the creators ship **one weapon per mod**, never all three. Work is in git (`bb44073`,
  `0084881`) and reappliable.
- **Vulture on Origins is a compromise** — ships with `vulture_perk_actor` and
  `vulture_perk_scriptmover` dropped, so the stink pile is invisible there (its entity is a bare
  `tag_origin`). Under "perfectly or not at all" this should be revisited: either revert Vulture on
  Origins or free the bits.
- **Origins generator ring** — the v1.55.2 intro-hold change was shipped as a falsifiable test and
  has never been booted. The probe logs objective index / contested state / players-in-zone.
- **Who's Who damage path** — the pointer is fine (probe confirmed). Remaining lead is
  `zm_tomb_tank::tank_ran_me_over` doing `disableinvulnerability()` then `dodamage(health+1000)`,
  which is also the best lead for `.god` dropping out.
- **`.hud` toggles** — `.hud` off/on plus `.hudtimer` / `.hudhealth` / `.hudcounters`. Dvars exist.
